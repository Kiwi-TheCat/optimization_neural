# optimization_neural


## Task to do
Noemi:
- color plot of auto-encoder's weight matrix over iterations
- difference of the optimizers, plot showing convergence path difference
- Add regularization

Jessica:
- Start making slides (Canva): 
    - Explain motivation of compression
    - Visualize neural data
    - Explain delta encoding
    - Explain auto-encoding and basic gradient descent optimization

Together:
- Ask for suggestion on the code after regularization added.
